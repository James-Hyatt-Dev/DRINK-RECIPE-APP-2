I have already set up the majority of the  CLI project...

No factoring has been done, not gems that will increase the usersexperience have
been installed. 

I am simply recordin as I try to break it and set up any error handling that has not
already been done. 

Thanks for watching!


Possible refactoring
    user input Q for quit
    error handling?


ideas for better app
    gems to better the appearance and user experience
        colorize?

        something that displays the large options for the user in a more readable "table" of choices?
